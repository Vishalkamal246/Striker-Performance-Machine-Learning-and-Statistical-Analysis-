Project Description:
  The project involves utilizing data analytics techniques to explore and understand the characteristics and performance metrics of strikers.
  By employing descriptive statistics, data visualization, feature engineering, and machine learning algorithms.
  we aim to identify the key attributes that contribute to a striker's success on the field and classify them into different categories based on their performance.

Purpose:
  The primary purpose of this project is to provide a systematic framework for analyzing and categorizing strikers based on their performance metrics and personal attributes.
  By doing so, coaches, scouts, and football analysts can gain valuable insights into the characteristics of top-performing strikers and make informed decisions in team selection, recruitment, and strategic planning.

Required Tools:
  Python programming language
  Jupyter Notebook
